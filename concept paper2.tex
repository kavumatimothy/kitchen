\textbf{Human-computer interaction using motion gestures}
\section{Abstract}
Motion-gesture peripherals have become popular in recent years, with Leap motion, Myo and Kinect being a few examples. In this project the student will develop an application to use such peripherals. The student is free to approach the challenge as they see fit, but would be expected to design, implement and assess the tools they develop. The tool would also need to serve a meaningful purpose. These projects tend to have a strong focus on human-computer interaction elements, particularly on designing and implementing user-friendly and meaningful motion gestures for a variety of real-world applications. Past students for instance have developed support for Myo on Android devices (so one does not have to touch a tablet screen while cooking) as well as added leap motion and Kinect support to cyber security visualization tools. Suitable for 3rd or 4th year undergraduates, or MSc. Other projects on novel human-computer interfaces possible, depending on interest and inspiration.
